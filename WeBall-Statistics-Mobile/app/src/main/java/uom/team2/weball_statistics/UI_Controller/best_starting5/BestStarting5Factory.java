    /* +/- – the plus/minus statistic is a measure of the point differential when players are in and
    out of a game. It is calculated by taking the difference in the score when the player enters the
    game and subtracting it from the score when the player exits the game. These differences are added
    up over the entire game to give the score. Thus, it is a measure of the impact a player has on the
    score of the game when he is in the game without measuring any specific statistic. */

    /* Effic – a measure of a player's efficiency, Effic = Pts + Rebs + Ast + Stl + Blk – (TO + FG Misses + FT Misses) */
